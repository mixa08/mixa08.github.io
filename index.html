					<h2>Physical and mental benefits of taekwondo</h2>
					
					<h5>1. IMPROVED MUSCLE TONING: Starting with one of the most obvious observations you’ll likely experience, Taekwondo focuses a lot on performing different sets of kicks and strikes. After drills have been repeated over and over to get a good understanding of how to perform a move, you’ll likely notice that you will have lost some weight and maybe even put on some muscle mass. Awesome, keep going!</h5>

					<h5>2. INCREASED STAMINA: Going along with muscular changes, rigorous training in Taekwondo can help improve your stamina as well. When practicing Taekwondo, it’s important to consider how long you will be able to perform different kicks, blocks, strikes, and other moves. At first, you might find yourself trying to catch your breath after just a few moves or a few minutes of sparring practice, but this feeling will reduce with enough practice over time. </h5>

					<h5>3. MORE CONFIDENCE: They say that part of getting what you want comes from having a positive attitude, and a positive outlook about yourself. When it comes to Taekwondo, this also holds true. Being able to perform some of the most advanced kicks, for example, requires having enough confidence in yourself so that you remain balanced and don’t fall over. Let’s also say that your self-esteem will also become enhanced over time as well, meaning that you will be more committed to continue practicing Taekwondo – even if it gets hard sometimes. </h5>

					<h5>4. REFLEXES YOU NEVER KNEW YOU HAD IN YOU: Have you ever experienced that feeling where time almost feels slower around you? That feeling where you are able to quickly handle something that would normally be too fast for you to handle is something you can actually train yourself to control and use. This is common in many martial arts and competitive sports, but Taekwondo provides another method to reach that level of reflexes. </h5>

					<h5>9. RESPECT: Taekwondo is built on a set of traditions and philosophies that are still practiced to this very day. Starting from the very first class, the student is being trained to show respect to their peers, their instructors, and with anyone else they encounter outside of their classes too.</h5>

					 <h5>10. IMPROVED ABILITY TO PLAN AND FOLLOW-THROUGH: Taekwondo is a discipline that takes time to learn and become proficient at. As a new student enters a class for their first time, they are also entering into a long-term plan that they have knowingly or unknowingly envisioned for themselves. That plan is on attaining new skills and devoting time to practicing a discipline. Each step of the way has specific goals, is measurable, is achievable and realistic, and can be looked at over time. You may have heard of SMART goals before, and you’ll notice that Taekwondo not only has smart goals, but it also teaches you how to create and follow through on any SMART goal you set out to do. </h5>
